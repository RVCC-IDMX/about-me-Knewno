            <div id="lore">
                <p>"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that,
                    whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
                    separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge
                    sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a
                    meaning to it."</p>

                <p>"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to
                    him?"</p>

                <p>"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I
                    think that what he foresaw happened."</p>

                <p>"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"</p>

                <p>"None."</p>

                <p>"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"</p>

                <p>"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."</p>

                <p>"And your father? Did you tell him?"</p>

                <p>"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer
                    again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and
                    then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled
                    on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look
                    at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives
                    me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out
                    of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.</p>

                <p>"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach
                    some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell
                    upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from
                    your life."</p>

                <p>"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"</p>

                <p>"I fear not."</p>

                <p>"Then what has happened to him?"</p>

                <p>"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any
                    letters of his which you can spare."</p>

                <p>"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four
                    letters from him."</p>

                <p>"Thank you. And your address?"</p>

                <p>"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."</p>

                <p>"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"</p>

                <p>"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."</p>

                <p>"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember
                    the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to
                    affect your life."</p>

                <p>"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me
                    ready when he comes back."</p>

                <p>For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of
                    our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and
                    went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.</p>

                <p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs
                    stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from
                    the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned
                    back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite
                    languor in his face.</p>

                <p>"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little
                    problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my
                    index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the
                    idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most
                    instructive."</p>

                <p>"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.</p>
