            <div id="lore"><p>Poole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the lawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents ran thus: “Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He assures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his present purpose. In the year 18--, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large quantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous care, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at once. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can hardly be exaggerated.” So far the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer’s emotion had broken loose. “For God’s sake,” he added, “find me some of the old.”</p>
                <p>“This is a strange note,” said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, “How do you come to have it open?”</p>
                <p>“The man at Maw’s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like so much dirt,” returned Poole.</p>
                <p>“This is unquestionably the doctor’s hand, do you know?” resumed the lawyer.</p>
                <p>“I thought it looked like it,” said the servant rather sulkily; and then, with another voice, “But what matters hand of write?” he said. “I’ve seen him!”</p>
                <p>“Seen him?” repeated Mr. Utterson. “Well?”</p>
